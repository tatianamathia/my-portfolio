        <h2><li>About</li></h2>
        <p>I'm fresh out of high school and to be honest I want to do programming because of it's marketability in these times (tuliambiwa tubonyeze kompyuta).Apart from that, so far its been really interesting, more than I thought it would be.The thought of not succeding is a big motivator for me to stay focusedd and excel.Graduating Moringa will be an achievement, and I really look forward to make it a reality.Inshallah.</p>
          
        <h2><li>Skills</li></h2>
        <p>I think some of my strong suite non-technical skills are adaptability and emotional intelligence.Coming from a catholic school, I think those are some of the perks I cant fail to ackowledge.</p>
         
        <h2><li>Projects</li></h2>
        <p>For projects, I can only elaborate on the phase one labs I did. I particularly found the css-fundamental somewhat challenging, but completing it was a rewarding experience. </p>
